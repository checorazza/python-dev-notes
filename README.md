# üêç Python Dev Notes

Welcome to my Python Notes repository! This is where I store bite-sized lessons, concepts, and useful tips I've gathered on my Python journey.

This repo is meant for people who already know a bit of programming (loops, variables, conditionals, etc) and are looking to apply their knowledge in Python.

Still, my notes will cover from beginner level to advanced.
