# 1. Syntax

# Variables

Think of a variable as a "label" on a container. Whatever you assign to it (a number, text), it holds that value for later.

## Types

- **int:** Whole numbers, e.g., 5
- **float:** Decimal numbers, e.g., 5.5
- **str (string):** Text, e.g., "Hello"
- **bool (boolean):** True or False values

#### Example:

```
name = "Alice"  # string
age = 25        # integer
height = 5.7    # float
is_student = True  # boolean
```

# Basic Operators

- **Math Operators:** +, -, \*, / for basic math; \*\* for exponents; % for remainder.
- **Comparison Operators:** ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
- **Logical Operators:** and, or, not (to combine multiple conditions)

# Control Flow

## Conditional Statements:

```
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You're an adult.")
else:
    print("You're a minor.")
```

## Loops

### For

Repeats an action for a specific range or set of items.

```
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

### While

Repeats as long as a condition is True.

```
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

# Functions

## What is a Function?

A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. Think of it as a mini-program within your program.

## Why Use Functions?

- **Reusability:** Once a function is defined, you can use it as many times as you want without rewriting code.
- **Readability:** By breaking down complex tasks into smaller, named functions, code becomes easier to understand.
- **Modularity:** Functions make it easy to organize code into logical sections.

```
def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

- **def:** The keyword to define a function.
- **greet:** The name of the function. This should be descriptive of the task it performs.
- **()**: The parentheses can contain parameters (explained below) or be left empty if the function needs no input.
- **: symbol:** Signals the start of the function body.
  print("Hello, world!"): The function body (indented code block) that will execute whenever the function is called.

## Parameters and Arguments

Parameters are placeholders in the function definition, like variable names that you use inside the function.

Arguments are the actual values you pass into the function when you call it.

```
def greet(name):  # 'name' is a parameter
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")  # 'Alice' is an argument passed to 'name'
greet("Bob")    # 'Bob' is an argument passed to 'name'
```

This function is **flexible** because it can greet anyone based on the argument passed to it.

## Returning Values

Functions can also return values, which allows them to produce an output that can be used elsewhere in your code. Use the return keyword for this.

```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b  # This function returns the sum of a and b

result = add(3, 5)  # 'result' now holds the value 8
print(result)       # Outputs: 8
```

## Default Parameters

You can assign default values to parameters. If an argument isn't provided, the default value is used.

```
def greet(name="Guest"):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")  # Outputs: Hello, Alice!
greet()         # Outputs: Hello, Guest!
```

Here, if no argument is passed to greet(), the function uses "Guest" as the default value.
